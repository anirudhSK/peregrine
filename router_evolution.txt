Routers or switches (I use these two terms interchangeably) have a long history
starting with the ARPANET. The ARPANET was an experimental computer network
that ran over the telephone lines with the goal of interconnecting computers
across several research sites within the U.S for timesharing their computing
resources. The ARPANET later evolved into the Internet. There were two network
architectures that were in consideration for the ARPANET. The first from Larry
Roberts was to directly connect the computers (also known as hosts) to the
telephone lines and have them handle routing, flow control, and reliability.
The second from Wes Clark was to have a dedicated node at each site called an
Interface Message Processor (IMP), which would communicate over the phone lines
to IMPs at other sites. The hosts would then only have to worry about
communicating with their own IMP.

The second approach won out (Page 565 of the 1970 paper on the IMP) primarily
because it decoupled network functionality into IMP functions (routing,
reliability, congestion control) and host functions (application logic for
generating network messages), allowing them to evolve independently.
Practically this meant hosts, which significantly outnumbered IMPs, weren't
disrupted during network upgrades.  For instance, the carrier phone lines could
be replaced with a different communication technology---or a new routing
protocol could be deployed---by upgrading IMPs alone, without disrupting the
hosts. This made it very easy for new hosts to connect to the ARPANET, and was
critical to the rapid growth of the ARPANET. In the mid 1970s, the same idea
was critical to Kahn and Cerf's vision of internetworking, where many
autonomous networks could be easily interconnected by using gateways without
involving all nodes within each autonomous network.

The IMPs were predecessors to the modern-day router and the original ARPANET
design illustrates {\it why} routers are critical to evolvability: they provide
a form of information hiding where many hosts or many autonomous networks can
easily connect to each other without having to understand every detail about
other hosts or other autonomous networks.

IMPs were minicomputers with special purpose forwarding software, which were
then rebranded as routers. The first IMP designed by Bolt, Beranak, and Newman
(BBN) in 1969 was a ruggedized Honeywell DDP-516 minicomputer
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_Message_Processor and "The interface
message processor for the ARPA computer network"). This IMP could connect to
multiple host computers, providing them all with access to the ARPANET. The
IMPs were an early form of what we call software routers today: they were
merely software running on top of a general purpose computer. This approach was
necessary for the IMPs because the ARPANET was still in a period of rapid
growth and reloading IMP code as assembly programs on top of a computer was key
to evolving the ARPANET. It was also sufficient because the telephone lines in
the ARPANET were wimpy by modern standards: they didn't exceed 100 kbits/s.

This approach of building routers by programming a minicomputer continued for
at least two decades even as routers evolved from IMPs on the ARPANET to
gateways for interconnecting networks to campus routers. Examples include David
Mills' Fuzzball router that provided the NSFNET (the successor to the ARPANET
in 1986 until 1995, when it evolved into the modern-day Internet) 56-kbit
routing backbonne. The Fuzzball ran atop the PDP-11/73 minicomputers. Other
examples include MIT/Noel Chiappa's C gateway project (1984); Proteon, a
startup out of MIT in the 80s, and William Yeager's "Ships in the Night"
Stanford campus router from 1981, which eventually formed the basis of Cisco in
1987---perhaps, the first large company devoted exclusively to networking.

Software routers were also sufficient during this time frame (roughly 1969 when
the IMPs first surfaced until about 1995). Around 1995, the Internet really
took off, and the explosive growth of the Internet in the form of rising
traffic volumes resulted in growing demand for higher and higher link speeds.
The net result of this is that most of the routers used in production since
then have essentially been designed from the ground up (right from the logic
gates) for the sole purpose of forwarding packets.

Possibly the first example of this was the Juniper M40
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniper_M_Series#M40), Juniper Networks' first
product in 1998 that could have also been the first ASIC that explicitly
targeted networking. The Juniper M40 was between 10 and 100 times faster than
other software routers at the time and was historic in introducing the move
towards ASIC-based designs for routers. This was probably influenced by the
VLSI background of Juniper's founder Pradeep Sindhu
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pradeep_Sindhu), who was instrumental in
designing the M40. Juniper may have also been responsible in part for getting
CISCO investing more heavily in ASIC development for routers (because software
routers no longer scaled) and the M40
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniper_M_Series#M40) was probably the first
design to explicitly decouple the router control and data planes---an idea that
is at the root of software-defined networking today.
